## Description

Remember the days when the internet was a place of real connection? When conversations were thoughtful, communities were close-knit, and every post felt like it mattered? Retro-Net brings you back to that golden age with a modern twist.

An old school forum for all your nostalgic needs on the Information Super Highway. It takes inspiration from the early days of  message boards from the late 90s and early 2000s. No more doomscrolling TikTok, or Instagram, Retro-Net has everything you'll ever need! Community, weird fonts, and good old-fashioned communication.

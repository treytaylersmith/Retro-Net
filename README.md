# Retro-Net
An old school forum for all your nostalgic needs on the Information Super Highway

It showcases the simplicity and beauty of the old-fasiond internet forums by:

- Creating and Uploading posts.
- Commenting on posts.

This is done like with any forumn website that allows you to post any type of content that you want.

Some examples include:

- "Hello World this is my first post"
- "I agree/disagree with you opinion"
- "Here are some opinions that I want to share"

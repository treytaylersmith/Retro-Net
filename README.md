# Retro-Net
An old school forum for all your nostalgic needs on the Information Super Highway. It has taken inspiration from the early days of the message boards from the late 90s and early 2000s as opposed to the modern social media shortcomings.

It showcases the simplicity and beauty of the old-fasiond internet forums by:

- Creating and Uploading posts.
- Commenting on posts.
- Having minamilist layouts.
- The lack of doom-scrolling.
- Being a proper community-driven website.

This is done like with any forumn website that allows you to post any type of content that you want.

Some examples include:

- "Hello World this is my first post"
- "I agree/disagree with you opinion"
- "Here are some opinions that I want to share"
